Push Script: Needs one argument in order to store on the remote server. This additional
argument can be a file or directory.

Pull Script: Needs one argument in order to pull from the remote server. This additional
argument can be a file or directory.

Push and Pull Arguments:

    -error: Takes no additional arguments and will make sure to output additional
    lines of output to assist in debugging.

    -storage: Takes one additional argument. The argument is the location to be used
    on the server to store or pull from. There is one hitch to this concept. For the
    push scsript, if there is no occurence of the item you are storing, then the item
    will be stored in the base directory of the storage location. If there is one
    occurence of the item that you are storing on the server and the storage location is 
    in the absolute path of where your item is, then that item will get updated. The
    item will not be put into the base directory of the storage location that you
    specify. The same concept will go for the pull script but just retrieving the item,
    instead of storing. The reason is due to the recursive find in the scripts. This is
    a major feature because of not allowing multiple of the same items to be store on
    in the storage loacation. In order to store in a completely different location, you
    will have to specify a location that is based off your home directory and then a
    different directory, like the following: /home/user/Desktop or /home/user/Documents.

    -remote: Takes one additionalargument. The argument is the head name contained 
    within the .locations file. The scripts will uppercase the additional argument
    and all head names contained in the .locations file should be uppercase.


Test Script: This is used to run the pull and push script. This will ensure that they
are working correctly. Please make sure to run the test in the following way:
source ./test.sh

Test Arguments:

    -push: Takes no additional arguments and will make sure to run only the push
    script tests.

    -pull: Takes no additional arguments and will make sure to run only the pull
    script tests.

    -storage: Takes one additional argument. The argument is the location to be used
    on the server to store or pull from. You will not have to worry about including
    the home directory, just put anything from the home directory.

    -remote: Takes one additionalargument. The argument is the head name contained 
    within the .locations file. The scripts will uppercase the additional argument
    and all head names contained in the .locations file should be uppercase.

Setup Script: This is used to setup the client and server for this package. 

Setup Arguments:

    -client: Takes no additional arguments and will only setup the client computer 
    for this package.

    -server: Takes no additional arguments and will only setup the server computer 
    for this package.

    -develop: Takes no additional arguments and will setup the development directory
    for this package. This is located in .monday/test.
